# Next.js User Profile Page

## Purpose
Develop a simple landing page that includes a header, a few sections with placeholder text, and a footer.
Implement Static Site Generation (SSG) for the landing page. (npm run build)


## Pages

### User Profile Page, does not work

- The user profile page is implemented in `pages/users.tsx`.
- It dynamically fetches user data from the JSONPlaceholder API and displays it on the page.
- User profiles are accessed via dynamic routes based on user IDs.

### Index Page (Could Not Get it to Work)

- The index page is configured in `pages/index.html`.
- It serves as the landing page of the application.
- Unfortunately, I encountered issues with this page and could not get it to work properly. Further troubleshooting is needed.

## Usage

1. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
