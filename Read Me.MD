# Express Server

This is a simple Express server application that demonstrates basic routing and error handling.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/Aki047/AD-320/Week3.git>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd express-server
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server will listen on port 3000. You can specify a different port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

Once the server is running, you can access the following endpoints:

- `/`: Returns a "Hello World" message.
- `/about`: Returns an "About page" message.
- Any other route: Returns a "404 - Not Found" error message.
